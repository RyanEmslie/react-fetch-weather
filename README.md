React
OpenWeatherAPI
IP API

This React App displays the 12-hour weather forcast for the users location.  
The location is determined by the users IP address and uses the lat long inforation.
The weather forcast is accessed based on the fetched lat lon through the weather API.

TODO
[] IP API fetch CORS error in Brave browser - cannot reproduce in check-in app
[] further separate logic from UI
[] refactor code
[] Manually enter location via zip/address/city
[] Convert For Loops
[] Separate fetch from App.js ?
